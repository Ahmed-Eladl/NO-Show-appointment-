# NO-Show-appointment-
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.

● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.

● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
